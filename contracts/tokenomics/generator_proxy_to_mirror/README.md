# Astroport Generator Proxy for Mirror Protocol Staking Rewards

This generator proxy contract interacts with the MIR-UST staking contract. Stake and rewards based on locked LP token amount by liquidity pool providers (dual rewards feature). For a diagram of how dual reward proxies work, you can take a look [here](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*8hn2NSnZJZTa9YGV).
